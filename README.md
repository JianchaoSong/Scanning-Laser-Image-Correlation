Scanning Laser Image Correlation (SLIC) analysis

This software perfroms 
SLIC analysis as described in:

"Scanning laser image correlation for measurement of flow" MJ Rossow, WW 
Mantulin, E Gratton, Journal of biomedical optics. 15 (2), 026003-026003-8

SLIC can be used to analyze the fluid velocity of particles traveling 
through microfluidic channels. 

plot_examples.m contains an exmample of SLIC analysis using simulated data.
Simulated data can be created with simple_flow_simulation.m
