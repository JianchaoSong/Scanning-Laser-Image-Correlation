Scanning Laser Image Correlation (SLIC) analysis

This software perfroms 
SLIC analysis as described in:

Rossow, Molly J, William W Mantulin, and Enrico Gratton. 2010. “Scanning 
Laser Image Correlation for Measurement of Flow.” J Biomed Opt 15 (2) 
(March): 026003-026003-8.

SLIC can be used to analyze the fluid velocity of particles traveling 
through microfluidic channels. 

plot_examples.m contains an exmample of SLIC analysis using simulated data.
Simulated data can be created with simple_flow_simulation.m
